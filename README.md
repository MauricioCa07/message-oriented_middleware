# MESSAGES ORIENTED MESSAGES

In this poject we're presenting an entire architecture with an API rest, a cluster of MOM's and some clients. 

The idea is that the clients will
    - create and delete topics 
    - create and delete queues
    - create and delete messages inside each structure

## How to run the project 
    ### API REST

**UNIX** Go inside `rest_API` and run the following command
```console 
    rm -rf build/;mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..;make;./mom
```

**WINDOWS** Go inside `rest_API` and run the following command
```console 
    Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build; New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path build; Set-Location -Path build; cmake ..; make; ./mom
```
After this your endpoints should be running


    ### MOM


**UNIX** Go inside `mom_communication` and run the following command
```console 
    rm -rf build/;mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..;make
```

**WINDOWS** Go inside `rest_API` and run the following command
```console 
    Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build; New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path build; Set-Location -Path build; cmake ..; make; ./mom
```
> you should clone, compile and link the grpc library be aware that for this project we use the v1.71.0
